#Method: Find and replace.
#Situation: You run a business. One of your clients has sent you an email saying they submitted an order incorrectly, and now you \
#must scan through your master file of clients and orders to find their order, and replace it with the correct one.

#variable = to a readline function to scan through the file line by line.
#between each line switch, compare that variable to the clients name to check if its the right person.
#find and replace function to then swap their order for something else, we'll figure out what later
#May need to find a way to isolate the scope of the find and replace function, as it will swap out EVERYTHING in the file = to the criteria
#Make a variable = to the line containing an order, modify that and then write it into the function.
